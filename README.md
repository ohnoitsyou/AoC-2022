Advent of Code 2022

I'm doing it in Kotlin again this year!

I've really enjoyed using Kotlin over the last couple years and think I still have a lot to learn about the language so I'm going to continue to use it.

I'm doing my best to solve challenges as they come in but we all know there's eventually going to be one I give up early on.

# Build
    ./gradlew build

# Run
    ./gradlew run
